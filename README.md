ConnectWise MCP Server
A Docker-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) bridge server that provides read-only AI-assisted ConnectWise Manage access through OpenWebUI. This server enables AI agents to search, read, and analyze ConnectWise data via natural language commands.

 Architecture
The ConnectWise MCP Server consists of two components:

MCP Server - Python-based server that interfaces with ConnectWise Manage API
MCP Bridge - Node.js Express server that exposes an HTTP API for OpenWebUI

 Prerequisites
Docker and Docker Compose installed
ConnectWise Manage API credentials (Company ID, Public Key, Private Key)
OpenWebUI already running (any version with Tools support)
 Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ConnectWise-MCP-Server
2. Configure ConnectWise Credentials
Create a .env file from the example:

cp .env.example .env
Edit .env and add your ConnectWise credentials:

# ConnectWise API Credentials (required)
CW_COMPANY_ID=your_company_id_here
CW_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
CW_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# ConnectWise API Configuration
CW_API_URL=https://api-na.myconnectwise.net
CW_API_VERSION=v2023.2
CW_CLIENT_ID=mcp-connectwise-server

# MCP Bridge Server Port (default: 3002)
MCP_PORT=3002

# Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
3. Obtaining ConnectWise API Credentials
Log in to your ConnectWise Manage instance
Navigate to System → Members
Create a new API Member or use existing credentials
Generate API Keys:
Go to My Account → API Keys
Click New to create new API keys
Save the Public Key and Private Key
Your Company ID is typically shown in the URL or system settings
Important: For read-only access, ensure the API member only has read permissions in ConnectWise.

4. Start the Server
Using the setup script (recommended):

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
Select option 1 to start the server.

Or manually with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d --build
The ConnectWise MCP Bridge will be available at: http://localhost:3002

5. Install in OpenWebUI
Open OpenWebUI in your browser
Go to Settings → Admin Panel → Tools
Click "+ Create New Tool"
Copy the contents of connectwise_tools.py from this repository
Paste into the tool editor
Configure the bridge URL in the Valves section:
If OpenWebUI is in Docker: http://connectwise-mcp-bridge:3002
If OpenWebUI is local: http://localhost:3002
Click "Save"
Enable the ConnectWise Tools
6. Test the Connection
Test the health endpoint:

curl http://localhost:3002/health
Expected response:

{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "connectwise-mcp-bridge"
}
 Usage
Once the ConnectWise Tools are installed in OpenWebUI, you can use natural language commands:

Example queries:

"Show me all open tickets for ACME Corp"
"Find all companies with 'Tech' in their name"
"Get details for ticket #12345"
"List all opportunities with status 'Open'"
"Show me time entries for this week"
"Find contacts at Microsoft"
"What projects are currently active?"
"Show me all agreements expiring this month"
The AI will automatically call the appropriate ConnectWise tool functions to complete your request.

 ConnectWise API Conditions Examples
ConnectWise uses a powerful condition syntax for filtering:

# String equality
identifier="ACME"

# Contains (like)
name like "%Corp%"

# Date comparisons
dateEntered > [2024-01-01]

# Numeric comparisons
id > 1000

# Multiple conditions
status/name="New" and company/identifier="ACME"

# Nested fields
company/name like "%Tech%"

🔍 Troubleshooting
Authentication Errors
If you receive authentication errors:

Verify your Company ID, Public Key, and Private Key are correct
Ensure the API member has appropriate permissions
Check that the API URL matches your ConnectWise instance
Generate new API keys if needed
Port Already in Use
If port 3002 is already in use:

Edit .env file:

MCP_PORT=3003
Edit docker-compose.yml: Update port mapping to 3003:3002 and environment PORT=3003

Restart:

docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d --build
Update bridge URL in OpenWebUI Tool Valves

Bridge Not Responding
Verify bridge is running: docker-compose ps
Check bridge logs: docker-compose logs mcp-bridge
Test health endpoint: curl http://localhost:3002/health
Check bridge URL in OpenWebUI Tool Valves settings:
If both in Docker on same network: http://connectwise-mcp-bridge:3002
If OpenWebUI is local: http://localhost:3002
OpenWebUI Can't Connect
Make sure you saved the connectwise_tools.py in OpenWebUI Tools
Enable the ConnectWise Tools in OpenWebUI Settings
Verify the bridge URL is correct in Valves settings
Check if Docker networks are connected:
docker network connect openwebui_network connectwise-mcp-bridge
Rate Limiting
ConnectWise has API rate limits. If you encounter rate limiting:

Reduce the pageSize parameter
Add delays between requests
Check ConnectWise API documentation for current limits

 Security Best Practices
Never commit .env file with real credentials to version control
Use API-only member accounts with minimum required permissions
Read-only access: This server is designed for read-only operations only
Regularly rotate API credentials
Limit IP access to ConnectWise API if possible
Run bridge server in private network when possible
Monitor API usage and set quotas
